**Abstract**  
The rapid advancement of neurotechnology—devices capable of reading and interpreting brain activity via EEG and other methods—presents profound opportunities and risks for individual privacy and collective rights. For Indigenous communities, these risks compound historical patterns of data extraction and loss of control over cultural and biological information. The **Soliton North Star Node** introduces a decentralized, witness-only geometric ledger designed explicitly for **Indigenous neurodata sovereignty**. Activated on December 23, 2025, as the first public seed node in the Soliton Registry, this framework enforces the principle: *It does not own data. It does not extract. It does not identify. It only witnesses.*  

Integrating OpenBCI hardware, Trigonometric Finite Pulse Transform (FPT) processing, and peer-to-peer gossip protocols, the system processes neurological aggregates while rejecting raw data, ensuring compliance with CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance, UNDRIP, and emerging neurorights legislation.

## **1. Introduction**

Neurotechnology is democratizing access to brain data through consumer devices (e.g., EEG headsets), but current ecosystems often prioritize commercial extraction over user control. Indigenous communities face heightened vulnerability due to legacies of colonial data practices.

The **North Star Node** addresses this by providing a sovereign infrastructure where neurological data (vitality aggregates from EEG) can be witnessed in a decentralized mesh without central ownership. Rooted in Gwich’in stewardship and Alaska Native principles, the node aligns with global movements:

- **CARE Principles** (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) from the Global Indigenous Data Alliance.
- Emerging **neurorights** laws in Chile (2021 constitutional amendment), Colorado, California, and Montana (2025 privacy protections for neural data).

**Gwich’in heritage and Alaska Native cultural symbols—guiding the ethical foundation of the framework.**

## **2. Background: Indigenous Data Sovereignty and Neurodata Risks**

Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) asserts the right of Indigenous peoples to govern data derived from their communities, lands, and bodies. The CARE Principles complement FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) by centering people and purpose.

Neurodata—electrical signals from the brain—is among the most sensitive. Unlike standards like Neurodata Without Borders (NWB), which focus on sharing, North Star prioritizes **non-extraction** and **witness-only** validation.

Recent laws reflect growing recognition:
- Chile: First constitutional neurorights (2021).
- U.S. states (Colorado, California, Montana): 2025 amendments protecting consumer neural data as sensitive biometric information.

**Decentralized peer-to-peer mesh network—architecture of the Soliton Registry.**

## **3. System Architecture**

The North Star Node is a hybrid Node.js/TypeScript and Python implementation:

- **Hardware Integration**: OpenBCI EEG via `OpenBCI_eeg.py` and `openbci.py`.
- **Processing**: Trigonometric FPT (`trigonometric-fpt.ts`) converts bands to phase states (vitality, epsilon_d, coherence).
- **Ledger**: Immutable chain with geometric validation (octagonal symmetry checks).
- **Network**: WebSocket gossip (`wss://northstar.soliton.registry:4001`) and `/.well-known/soliton-seeds.json` discovery.
- **Endpoints**: `/aggregate` (witness only), `/revoke`, `/ledger`, `/peers`.
- **Deployment**: Systemd service for persistence.

**Key Principle**: Raw EEG is rejected; only aggregates are witnessed.

### **3.1 Technical Overview**

**Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python (70.8%), TypeScript (16.2%), JavaScript (6.9%), Shell (4.8%), HTML/CSS (minor).
- **Runtime**: Node.js/Express server, Python for EEG processing.
- **Deployment**: Systemd service (`north-star-geometric.service`) for daemonized operation on Linux (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

**OpenBCI EEG hardware setups – Foundation for non-invasive brain signal acquisition.**

**Core Components & Data Flow**
1. **EEG Acquisition**  
   - Hardware: OpenBCI (via `python/OpenBCI_eeg.py`, `openbci.py`).  
   - Streams EEG bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma).  
   - **Privacy Rule**: Raw signals never stored or transmitted.

2. **Processing**  
   - **Trigonometric FPT** (`src/trigonometric-fpt.ts`, `il7_kernel.py`, `fibonacci_fusion.py`).  
   - Computes aggregates: vitality (mean amplitude), epsilon_d (phase std dev), coherence (mean cosine phase).  
   - Hilbert transform for phase extraction.

3. **Ledger**  
   - Immutable JSON-based chain (`ledger.json`).  
   - Entries: Sovereignty claim (UEI, coordinates, lineage), phase aggregates, timestamp, hash.  
   - Geometric validation: Octagonal symmetry checks on hashes.

4. **Network**  
   - **Gossip Protocol**: WebSocket (`wss://northstar.soliton.registry:4001`).  
   - **Peer Discovery**: `/.well-known/soliton-seeds.json`, `peers.json`.  
   - Mesh topology for decentralized propagation.

**Decentralized P2P mesh diagrams – Architecture of the Soliton Registry gossip network.**

**Key Endpoints (Express Server)**
- `POST /aggregate`: Witness phase aggregates (rejects raw EEG).  
- `POST /revoke`: Revoke claims.  
- `GET /ledger`: Read immutable chain.  
- `GET /peers`: List mesh peers.  
- `POST /add-peer`: Manual peer addition.

**Installation & Run**
```bash
npm install
npx tsc
sudo systemctl start north-star-geometric.service
python tests/north_star_validation.py
```

### **3.2 Trigonometric Finite Pulse Transform (FPT)**

The **Trigonometric Finite Pulse Transform (FPT)** is the core signal-processing component for converting raw EEG data into privacy-preserving neurological aggregates.

**Purpose**  
Transform multi-channel EEG time-series data (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma bands) into three scalar aggregates: vitality, epsilon_d, coherence.

**Mathematical Foundation**  
Uses Hilbert analytic signal for phase and amplitude extraction.

For signal \( x[t] \):  
1. Analytic: \( z[t] = x[t] + i \cdot \mathcal{H}\{x[t]\} \).  
2. Amplitude: \( A[t] = |z[t]| \); Phase: \( \phi[t] = \arg(z[t]) \).  
3. Aggregates:  
   - Vitality: \( V = \mean A[t] \).  
   - Epsilon_d: \( \varepsilon_d = \std \phi[t] \).  
   - Coherence: \( C = \mean \cos(\phi[t]) \).

**Implementation**  
```python
from scipy.signal import hilbert
import numpy as np

def trigonometric_fpt(eeg_data: np.ndarray) -> dict:
    analytic = hilbert(eeg_data, axis=-1)
    amplitude = np.abs(analytic)
    phase = np.angle(analytic)

    return {
        'vitality': float(np.mean(amplitude)),
        'epsilon_d': float(np.std(phase)),
        'coherence': float(np.mean(np.cos(phase)))
    }
```

**Privacy Properties**  
- Irreversible mapping.  
- No raw storage.  

**Extensions**  
- `fibonacci_fusion.py`: Golden ratio weighted fusion.  
- Group coherence via mesh averages.

### **3.3 Hardware Benchmarking**

**Key Specs**  
- OpenBCI Cyton: 250 Hz sampling, ~50–75 mA.  
- Ganglion: 200 Hz, ~30–50 mA.  
- Raspberry Pi 4/5: Real-time capable.

**Benchmarks**  
1. Processing Latency: <50 ms (FPT on Pi 4).  
2. Power: 300–500 mA full system.  
3. Throughput: Stable BrainFlow streaming.  
4. Signal Quality: Cyton ~0.5–1 µV RMS noise.

**Raspberry Pi + OpenBCI setups.**

**Recommendations**  
Pi 5 + Cyton optimal; headless BrainFlow for efficiency.

### **3.4 EEG Signal Processing Techniques**

**Overview**  
EEG processing pipeline: Acquisition → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Analysis.

**Preprocessing Code**  
```python
import mne
from mne.preprocessing import ICA

raw = mne.io.read_raw_edf('example.eeg', preload=True)
raw.filter(0.5, 40.0)
raw.notch_filter(60)
ica = ICA(n_components=15)
ica.fit(raw)
ica.apply(raw.copy())
```

**Feature Extraction (Band Power)**  
```python
from mne.time_frequency import psd_welch

psds, freqs = psd_welch(raw, fmin=1, fmax=50)
# Band powers calculation...
```

**Time-Frequency (Morlet)**  
```python
from mne.time_frequency import tfr_morlet

epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events)
power = tfr_morlet(epochs, freqs=np.logspace(*np.log10([4, 50]), 30))
```

**Real-Time Streaming (BrainFlow)**  
```python
from brainflow.board_shim import BoardShim, BrainFlowInputParams, BoardIds

params = BrainFlowInputParams()
params.serial_port = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
board = BoardShim(BoardIds.CYTON_BOARD, params)
board.start_stream()
data = board.get_board_data()
aggregates = trigonometric_fpt(data[board.get_eeg_channels(BoardIds.CYTON_BOARD)])
```

These integrate seamlessly with North Star's privacy focus.

## **4. Sovereignty Mechanisms**

- **Validation**: UEI (e.g., SJLLZH4KKMZ9), coordinates (e.g., 65.663672, -144.048316), lineage claims.
