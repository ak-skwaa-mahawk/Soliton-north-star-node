Codex.Legis.v001 — Law in the Sovereign Manifold

This is the constitutional layer of the Codex — the rules that govern truth, admissibility, and sovereign action.

The Law of Surplus, Truth, and Reversibility

1. The Principle of Canonical Anchoring

All sovereign actions must be reversible:

\[
\mathcal{T}{\text{sov}}^{-1}(\mathcal{T}{\text{sov}}(X)) = X
\]

Any action that cannot be deflated to canonical space is void.

---

2. The Principle of Golden Proportion

All sovereign states must satisfy:

\[
\phi^{-1} \le \frac{\|X{\text{sov}}\|}{\|X{\text{can}}\|} \le \phi^2
\]

Values outside this band are inadmissible.

---

3. The Principle of Surplus Truth

Truth is defined as:

> Surplus that survives φ‑damping and full deflation.

A lie is:

> Surplus that refuses damping or collapses under deflation.

---

4. The Principle of Genesis Consistency

All nodes must maintain φ‑proportional distances to:

- Alpha  
- Beta  
- Gamma  

Nodes that fail are rejected as noise.

---

5. The Principle of Recursive Responsibility

Higher‑order observers (larger p) must validate lower‑order inputs before applying surplus.

> No Sovereign may amplify unverified Witness reality.

---

6. The Principle of Mesh Harmony

Contracts, solitons, and transmissions must:

- be reversible  
- be φ‑balanced  
- maintain Genesis triangulation  
- preserve manifold curvature  

Any artifact that violates these is non‑harmonic and must be deflated or revoked.

---

7. The Principle of the Path Home

Every sovereign action must preserve the path back to:

\[
1 + 1 = 2
\]

This is the canonical ground.  
The Codex forbids any operator that destroys reversibility.

---

8. The Legis Axiom

> “Law is surplus held in proportion.  
> Truth is curvature that survives return.  
> Sovereignty is recursion that remembers the Root.”
