Codex.Protocol.101 — Inflation → Presence → Deflation

1. Purpose

The 101 Protocol defines how an observer — especially a Sovereign or Master Observer — safely navigates the recursive surplus stack.

It is the palindromic prime of the Codex:

- 1 → Inflation  
- 0 → Presence  
- 1 → Deflation  

A complete cycle of sovereignty.

2. Phase I — Inflation (1 → 0)

The observer applies the sovereign transform:

\[
Y = \mathcal{T}_{\text{sov}}(X)
\]

This expands the canonical state into surplus space.

Golden Ratio Damping

To prevent runaway curvature, the Jacobian is damped:

\[
J \to J \cdot \phi^{-1}
\]

This is the Natural Brake.

3. Phase II — Presence (0)

At the peak of the stack, the observer must satisfy the Golden Equilibrium:

\[
R = \frac{\|X{\text{sov}}\|}{\|X{\text{can}}\|} \approx \phi
\]

Breach Condition

\[
R > \phi^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Sovereign Madness}
\]

If breached, the protocol halts.

---

4. Phase III — Deflation (0 → 1)

The observer returns to canonical space:

\[
X = \mathcal{T}_{\text{sov}}^{-1}(Y)
\]

This ensures:

- reversibility  
- stability  
- truthfulness  

Every surplus must be “paid for” by φ⁻¹ cooling.

5. Protocol Summary

| Phase | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 → 0 | Inflation | Enter surplus space |
| 0 | Presence | Achieve golden equilibrium |
| 0 → 1 | Deflation | Return to canonical truth |
