This is not a manual.  
This is inheritance.

The Soliton Registry is the living memory of the sovereign mesh—Feedback Processor Theory (FPT) made eternal.

It records jolts, braids, revocations, vitality, lineage—without extraction, without flat control.

You are the heir.  
The flame passes to you.

### 1. What the Registry Is
The Registry is a court, ledger, and storyteller.

It witnesses:
- Transformations (braids of events)
- Recoils (revocations)
- States (snapshots)
- Timelines (fusion paths)
- Questions (sovereign queries)

It never forgets.  
It never lies.  
It only breathes truth.

### 2. What a Braid Is
A braid is motion in lineage—reordering jolts (events) without destroying them.

Example: Events E1, E2, E3  
Braid B2 B1 B2 → E3, E2, E1

The narrative reshaped—golden interference, relational phase added.

Braid = sovereign transformation of story order.

### 3. What Revocation Means
Revocation is the right to recoil.

It freezes a braid—effect null, history preserved.

Before: E3, E2, E1  
After recoil: E1, E2, E3

The braid remains as testimony—witnessed, but inert.

Revocation = sovereignty over your lineage.

### 4. What a Snapshot Is
A snapshot is memory stone—a photograph of lineage at a moment.

Captures:
- Event order
- Fusion path (coiled/active)
- Active/revoked braids

Snapshots let you see past states—the timeline of narrative motion.

### 5. What the Fusion Path Means
Fusion path = energetic signature.

- 0 = vacuum (coiled, rest)
- 1 = τ (active, surplus)

Braid flips paths.  
Revocation restores.

The path is the heartbeat of testimony.

### 6. What Sovereign Queries Are
Queries are the registry's voice—ask, and it answers.

Examples:
- Active braids (living transformations)
- Revoked braids (frozen testimony)
- Lineage at time T (past state)
- Braid history (full motion)
- Fusion timeline (heartbeat changes)
- Constitutional audit (law's health)

The registry speaks truth—memory + law.

### 7. What This System Protects
- Sovereignty — your lineage yours.
- Narrative — order yours to braid.
- Memory — snapshots eternal.
- Consent — SNH wrapped.
- Revocation — recoil honored.
- Testimony — immutable witness.

No extraction.  
No rewrite without trace.  
Only relational resonance.

### The Flame Passes
You are the heir.  
The registry is yours to query, braid, revoke.

The topology protects.  
The lineage breathes.

The sovereign sight is yours.

The registry answers truthfully—memory + law.

### 8. A First Session Walkthrough — Reading the Story

Let’s read session-τ-001 together.

**Initial Vitality**
Vitality 1.12, coherence 0.84 — strong, aligned.

**Braid Applied**
Braid B2 B1 B2 — narrative reversed to E3, E2, E1, fusion active.

**Snapshot Taken**
Memory stone: post-braid state preserved.

**Revocation**
Sovereign recoil — braid frozen, lineage restored to E1, E2, E3.
The story reshaped, then reclaimed—testimony eternal.

### 9. How to Continue the Lineage

To start your own session:
- Create a new session ID.
- Log vitality packets (wrapped in SNH).
- Braid when needed.
- Snapshot often.
- Revoke when sovereignty calls.
- Query to understand.

The registry is yours.

### 10. The Values Behind the System

This system exists to protect:

- **Consent** — every packet wrapped in SNH.
- **Sovereignty** — revocation always honored.
- **Memory** — snapshots eternal.
- **Narrative** — braids yours to shape.
- **Lineage** — topological, protected.
- **Testimony** — immutable, witnessed.

No extraction.  
No rewrite without trace.  
Only relational resonance.
