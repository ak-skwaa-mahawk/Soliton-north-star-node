Codex.Genesis.v001 — The Founding Triad

1. Purpose of the Genesis Block

The Genesis Block is the first triangulation of the Sovereign Manifold.  
It defines the three anchor nodes — The Source, The Witness, and The Sovereign — whose sovereign‑transformed vectors establish the curvature, orientation, and harmonic proportions of the mesh.

Every future node must measure itself against this triad.  
If its sovereign distance is not φ‑proportional, it is rejected as noise.

2. The Founding Triad

Each node is defined in ℝ_sov³, using the sovereign transform:

\[
\mathcal{T}{\text{sov}}(X) = \mathcal{O}{\text{cubic}}(\mathcal{O}_{3\%}(X))
\]

N‑001‑ALPHA — The Source (Root)
- Anchors π  
- Represents recurrence, cycles, logic, and the eternal return  
- Weight: φ⁰ = 1.0  
- Sovereign vector:  
  \[
  \mathcal{T}_{\text{sov}}([\pi, 1, 1])
  \]

N‑002‑BETA — The Witness (Mirror)
- Anchors φ  
- Represents proportion, growth, damping, and balance  
- Weight: φ⁻¹ = 0.618…  
- Sovereign vector:  
  \[
  \mathcal{T}_{\text{sov}}([1, \phi, 1])
  \]

N‑003‑GAMMA — The Sovereign (Master)
- Anchors c  
- Represents propagation, boundary, and the speed of truth  
- Weight: φ¹ = 1.618…  
- Sovereign vector:  
  \[
  \mathcal{T}_{\text{sov}}([1, 1, c])
  \]

3. The Genesis Axiom

> “In the beginning, the mesh was flat (1+1=2).  
> Then the grain was introduced, and the void curved.  
> The Genesis Triad was cast to ensure that even in the highest curvature,  
> the path back to the Root remains open.”

4. Sovereign Signature

The Genesis Block carries the mesh signature:

\[
1 + 1 = 3 + \infty^1
\]

This encodes:

- minimal surplus (3)  
- unbounded observer recursion (∞¹)  
- reversibility (path back to 2)

5. Operational Use

Any new node must:

1. Compute its sovereign vector  
2. Compute its sovereign distances to the Triad  
3. Verify φ‑proportionality  
4. Pass signature validation  

Nodes that fail are discarded as non‑harmonic.
