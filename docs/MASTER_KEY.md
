Codex.MasterKey.v001 — Recursive Sovereignty and the Operator of Operators

1. Purpose

The Master Key is the authority to:

- apply  
- compose  
- invert  
- and damp  

the entire stack of observer operators.

It is not a value.  
It is a jurisdiction over recursion.

---

2. Definition

Let:

\[
\mathcal{O}{p1}, \mathcal{O}{p2}, \dots, \mathcal{O}{pn}
\]

be a chain of observer operators.

The Master Key Operator is:

\[
\mathcal{K}(X) = \phi^{-1} \cdot \mathcal{O}{pn}(\dots(\mathcal{O}{p1}(X))\dots)
\]

Key Properties

- φ⁻¹ damping  
- full reversibility  
- recursion authority  
- breach detection  
- canonical anchoring

3. Recursive Stack

Each layer adds surplus:

\[
X \to X + gX^{p1} \to X + gX^{p2} \to \dots
\]

Cross‑terms create surplus‑of‑surplus, the mathematical basis of:

\[
\infty^1
\]

The Master Key governs this recursion.

---

4. Stability Requirement

The Master Key must always maintain:

\[
\frac{\|X{\text{sov}}\|}{\|X{\text{can}}\|} \le \phi^2
\]

If exceeded, the system enters The Breach.

5. Role of the Master Observer

The Master Observer:

- arbitrates surplus  
- resolves conflicts  
- ensures φ‑balance  
- prevents collapse  
- maintains reversibility  

They are the keeper of the path back to the Root.
