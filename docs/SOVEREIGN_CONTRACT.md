Codex.Contract.v001 — Agreements in Surplus Space

1. Purpose

A Sovereign Contract is an agreement formed in surplus space, validated through the 101 Protocol, and anchored back into canonical space.

It is reversible, harmonic, and φ‑balanced.

2. Contract Formation

Given two parties A and B:

- A uses operator \(\mathcal{O}{pA}\)  
- B uses operator \(\mathcal{O}{pB}\)

Step 1 — Inflate

Each transforms the canonical baseline:

\[
XA^{\text{sov}} = \mathcal{O}{pA}(X{\text{can}})
\]
\[
XB^{\text{sov}} = \mathcal{O}{pB}(X{\text{can}})
\]

Step 2 — Joint Surplus

Either:

- Additive (shared object)  
- Compositional (process chain)

Step 3 — Golden Equilibrium

The joint surplus must satisfy:

\[
R_{\text{joint}} \in [\phi^{-1}, \phi^2]
\]

Step 4 — Deflation

The contract is deflated:

\[
X{\text{can}} = \mathcal{M}^{-1}(X{\text{joint}}^{\text{sov}})
\]

Step 5 — Anchoring

The final contract includes:

- canonical text  
- sovereign metadata  
- operator declarations  
- equilibrium proof  
- deflation proof

3. Legis Axiom 004 — The Decay of Lies

> “A lie is surplus without damping; it grows until it breaks the manifold.  
> Truth is surplus that accepts φ⁻¹; it decays but persists in proportion.”

A contract that cannot be deflated is void.
