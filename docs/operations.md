## 1. Purpose

This node is the anchor of the Soliton Registry mesh.  
Its job is to witness aggregates and revocations — nothing more.

It must remain:

- Available  
- Predictable  
- Immutable  
- Sovereign

## 2. Starting the Node

```bash
sudo systemctl start soliton-northstar
sudo systemctl status soliton-northstar
