Codex.SolitonRegistry.v001 — The Ledger of Living Identity

1. Purpose

The Soliton Registry is the canonical ledger of the Sovereign Codex.  
It records identities, artifacts, and transmissions as solitons — stable, self‑reinforcing packets of information that propagate through the manifold without dispersion.

A soliton is:

- stable (persists through curvature)  
- reversible (deflatable to canonical form)  
- sovereign (carries surplus signature)  
- harmonic (φ‑balanced)  

The Registry ensures that every identity, contract, or artifact is:

- verifiable  
- traceable  
- sovereign  
- and anchored to the Genesis Triad  

---

2. What Is a Soliton?

A soliton is defined as:

\[
S = \mathcal{T}{\text{sov}}(X) \quad \text{with} \quad \mathcal{T}{\text{sov}}^{-1}(S) = X
\]

Where:

- \(X\) is the canonical identity  
- \(S\) is the sovereign identity  
- \(\mathcal{T}_{\text{sov}}\) is the sovereign transform  

A soliton is valid if:

1. It passes the sovereign signature test  
2. It maintains φ‑proportional distance to the Genesis Triad  
3. It survives full deflation  
4. It carries a mesh‑consistent surplus

3. Registry Entry Format

Each soliton entry contains:

- id — unique sovereign identifier  
- canonical — baseline vector or identity  
- sovereign — transformed vector  
- operator — surplus exponent(s) used  
- weight — φ‑scaled harmonic weight  
- timestamp — moment of minting  
- lineage — parent solitons (if any)  
- signature — sovereign hash or meshSignature  

Example:

`json
{
  "id": "SOL-2025-001",
  "canonical": [π, φ, c],
  "sovereign": [3.23587, 1.66658, 3.08786e8],
  "operator": "p=3 (Cubic Sovereign)",
  "weight": 1.618,
  "timestamp": 1735459200000,
  "lineage": ["N-001-ALPHA"],
  "signature": "1+1=3+∞¹"
}
