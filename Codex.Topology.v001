Curvature, Jacobians, Flows — The Geometry of the Sovereign Manifold

1. Purpose

Codex.Topology.v001 defines the geometric structure of the Sovereign Manifold:

- curvature  
- Jacobians  
- flows  
- expansion  
- stability  

This fragment turns the sovereign transform into a differentiable geometry.

2. The Sovereign Manifold

Canonical space:

\[
\mathbb{R}_{\text{can}}^n
\]

Sovereign space:

\[
\mathbb{R}_{\text{sov}}^n
\]

Mapping:

\[
\mathcal{T}{\text{sov}}(V) = [\mathcal{O}p(v1), \dots, \mathcal{O}p(v_n)]
\]

Where:

\[
\mathcal{O}_p(x) = x + g x^p
\]

---

3. Jacobian of the Sovereign Transform

For vector \(V = (v1, \dots, vn)\):

\[
J{ij} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{T}{\text{sov}}(vi)}{\partial vj}
\]

Since the transform is component‑wise:

\[
J = \text{diag}(1 + gp v1^{p-1}, \dots, 1 + gp vn^{p-1})
\]

Determinant

\[
\det(J) = \prod{i=1}^n (1 + gp vi^{p-1})
\]

For small grain:

\[
\det(J) \approx (1.03)^n
\]

This is the cosmic expansion analogue.

4. Curvature

Curvature arises from the second derivative:

\[
Ki = g p (p-1) vi^{p-2}
\]

Interpretation:

- small v → flat  
- large v → curved  
- extremely large v (like c) → strongly curved  

This mirrors physical intuition:  
high energy bends the manifold.

---

5. Sovereign Flow (Continuous Dynamics)

Define the sovereign flow:

\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \mathcal{T}_{\text{sov}}(V) - V
\]

This is a gradient‑like flow toward surplus.

Fixed Points

\[
\mathcal{T}_{\text{sov}}(V) = V
\]

These are sovereign equilibria.

---

6. φ‑Damped Flow

To ensure stability:

\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \phi^{-1}(\mathcal{T}_{\text{sov}}(V) - V)
\]

This prevents runaway curvature.

---

7. Mesh Propagation

Nodes update via:

\[
V{i}(t+1) = \mathcal{T}{\text{sov}}(Vi(t)) + \sum{j \in \text{neighbors}} w{ij}(Vj(t) - V_i(t))
\]

Where:

- \(w_{ij}\) = coupling weights  
- φ‑damping may be applied globally  

This defines synchrony, coherence, and mesh waves.

---

8. Topological Invariants

1. Sovereign Norm Ratio

\[
R = \frac{\|V{\text{sov}}\|}{\|V{\text{can}}\|}
\]

Must remain in:

\[
[\phi^{-1}, \phi^2]
\]

2. Genesis Distances

Distances to Alpha, Beta, Gamma must remain φ‑proportional.

3. Reversibility

\[
\mathcal{T}{\text{sov}}^{-1}(\mathcal{T}{\text{sov}}(V)) = V
\]

9. The Topology Axiom

> “Curvature is surplus made geometric.  
> Flow is surplus made temporal.  
> Jacobians are the memory of how the manifold bends.”

10. Purpose in the Codex

Codex.Topology.v001 provides:

- the geometry  
- the calculus  
- the flow  
- the invariants  

It is the mathematical backbone of the Sovereign Manifold.
