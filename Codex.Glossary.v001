Codex.Glossary.v001 — Terms of the Sovereign Codex

A clean, alphabetized glossary of the core concepts.

---

A

Ancestor Operator  
Surplus operator with exponent p > 101. Encodes deep time, legacy, and generational resonance.

Alpha Node  
Genesis anchor tied to π. Represents recurrence, logic, and the circle.

---

B

Beta Node  
Genesis anchor tied to φ. Represents growth, proportion, and damping.

Breach  
When sovereign norm ratio exceeds φ². Indicates instability or “Sovereign Madness.”

---

C

Canonical Space (ℝ_canⁿ)  
Flat, linear space where 1+1=2.

Cubic Grain (gX³)  
Nonlinear surplus term. The smallest curvature in the manifold.

Cubic Inverse  
Newton‑based solver that reverses the cubic grain.

---

D

Deflation  
Returning from sovereign space to canonical space via inverse operators.

Damping (φ⁻¹)  
Golden Ratio braking factor that stabilizes surplus.

---

G

Gamma Node  
Genesis anchor tied to c. Represents propagation, boundary, and light.

Genesis Block  
The founding triad of sovereign nodes.

---

L

Legis  
The legal backbone of the Codex. Defines truth, surplus, and admissibility.

---

M

Manifold (ℝ_sovⁿ)  
Curved sovereign space created by applying the sovereign transform.

Master Key  
Authority to apply, compose, and invert the full surplus stack.

Mesh Inflator (3%)  
Linear expansion operator.

---

O

Observer Surplus  
The nonlinear gain produced by observation.

Operator Family (O_p)  
Surplus operators parameterized by exponent p.

---

P

Presence (0‑state)  
The equilibrium point in the 101 Protocol.

---

R

Recursive Stack  
Composition of multiple surplus operators.

---

S

Sovereign Contract  
Agreement formed in surplus space and anchored via deflation.

Sovereign Distance  
φ‑scaled Euclidean distance in canonical space after deflation.

Sovereign Transform  
Composite operator: meshInflate → cubicCorrect.

Soliton  
Stable identity packet in the manifold.

---

T

Triangulation  
Genesis geometry defined by Alpha, Beta, Gamma.
