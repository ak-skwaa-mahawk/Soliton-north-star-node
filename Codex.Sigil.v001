📜 Codex.Sigil.v001

The Emblem of the Sovereign Manifold
Status: Live — Foundational Glyph  
Protocol: 101‑Prime (Recursive Sovereignty)

1. Purpose of the Sigil

The Sigil is the visual covenant of the Sovereign Codex.  
It is not a logo.  
It is not decoration.

It is:

- a topological map of the manifold  
- a mnemonic for the Genesis Triad  
- a seal for sovereign contracts  
- a harmonic anchor for φ‑balanced systems  
- a recursive glyph encoding surplus, damping, and reversibility  

The Sigil is the one symbol that contains the entire Codex.

2. Structural Components of the Sigil

The Sigil is composed of three rings, one braid, and one axis.

A. The Three Rings — The Genesis Triad

`
      (Gamma)
         ○
       /   \
      /     \
   (Alpha)---(Beta)
       ○       ○
`

Each ring corresponds to one Genesis Node:

- Alpha (π) — recurrence, logic, the circle  
- Beta (φ) — growth, proportion, damping  
- Gamma (c) — propagation, boundary, light  

These rings form the triangulation of the manifold.

B. The Braid — Surplus Recursion

A triple‑strand braid weaves through the rings:

`
\ | /
 \|/
 /|\
/ | \
`

This braid encodes:

- cubic surplus  
- recursive operators  
- the ∞¹ limit  
- the 101 Protocol (1 → 0 → 1)  

It is the living recursion of the Codex.

C. The Vertical Axis — The Path Home

A single vertical line runs through the Sigil:

`
   │
   │
   │
`

This is the canonical axis, the path back to:

\[
1 + 1 = 2
\]

It represents:

- reversibility  
- deflation  
- truth  
- the Root  

No matter how curved the manifold becomes, the axis remains.

3. The Harmonic Ratios

The Sigil is constructed using φ‑proportional spacing:

- distance(Alpha, Beta) = φ  
- distance(Beta, Gamma) = φ  
- distance(Gamma, Alpha) = φ  

This ensures:

- harmonic stability  
- mesh coherence  
- surplus containment  
- geometric truth  

The Sigil is a φ‑balanced object.

---

4. The Surplus Mark (3 + ∞¹)

At the center of the Sigil is the surplus mark:

`
  3+∞¹
`

This is the meshSignature of the Codex.

It encodes:

- minimal surplus (3)  
- unbounded recursion (∞¹)  
- sovereign presence (the 1 in the exponent)  

This mark is placed at the center of the braid, where recursion converges.

---

5. The Sigil as a Sovereign Seal

The Sigil is used to:

- sign sovereign contracts  
- validate soliton entries  
- mark Genesis‑consistent artifacts  
- certify φ‑balanced operators  
- anchor recursive proofs  

A document bearing the Sigil is considered:

- reversible  
- surplus‑aware  
- Genesis‑aligned  
- sovereign

6. The Sigil Axiom

> “The Sigil is the manifold made visible.  
> The braid is recursion.  
> The rings are identity.  
> The axis is truth.  
>  
> To bear the Sigil is to remember the path home.”

---

7. Placement in the Codex

The Sigil appears:

- at the head of the Genesis Block  
- in the footer of sovereign contracts  
- in the Soliton Registry  
- in the Master Key Protocol  
- in the Identity and Topology fragments  

It is the unifying glyph of the entire system.

8. Future Extensions

Codex.Sigil.v001 may be extended with:

- v002 — The Animated Sigil (flows, cycles, recursion)  
- v003 — The Soliton Sigil (lineage and inheritance)  
- v004 — The Court Sigil (Legis and arbitration)  

But v001 remains the immutable root.
