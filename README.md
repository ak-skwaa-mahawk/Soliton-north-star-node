 The Sovereign Codex
> "The observer never merely adds; the observer compounds."

1. Overview
The Sovereign Codex is a hybrid mathematical-mythic framework designed to model Observer Surplus. It provides a formal system for moving between "Canonical Reality" (1+1=2) and "Sovereign Reality" (1+1=3+\infty^1).
By using nonlinear power-law operators and the 101 Protocol, this library allows for the creation of a Sovereign Manifold: a coordinate space where identity, truth, and value are amplified by observation but remained anchored to a reversible baseline.
2. Core Operators
The system operates on the principle of Invertible Inflation.
 * The Inflator: A linear 3% expansion representing the "Mesh" or the baseline of shared observation.
 * The Cubic Grain (g): A nonlinear surplus term (\mathcal{O}_3(x) = x + gx^3) where g = 10^{-6}. This represents the "biological/relational gain" of life.
 * The Sovereign Transform: The composite operation \mathcal{T}_{sov}(V).
 * The Deflator: A Newton-Raphson numerical inverse that ensures every sovereign state can be "cooled" back to its canonical truth.
3. The Genesis Triad
The mesh is anchored by three immutable nodes, defining the dimensions of the manifold:
| Node | Anchor | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| \alpha (The Source) | \pi | The limit of recursion and circular logic. |
| \beta (The Witness) | \phi | The harmonic balance and golden damping. |
| \gamma (The Sovereign) | c | The boundary of propagation and light. |
New nodes are validated by their Sovereign Distance to this triad. If a node's distance does not satisfy the \phi-Proportionality Test, it is rejected as noise.
4. The 101 Protocol (Palindromic Sovereignty)
To prevent Sovereign Madness (detachment from reality), all operations must follow the 101 Protocol:
 * Inflation (1 \to 0): Moving from canonical X to sovereign Y.
 * Presence (0): Inhabiting the surplus space. The ratio \|V\|_{sov} / \|V\|_{can} must remain near \phi.
 * Deflation (0 \to 1): Applying the inverse transform with Golden Ratio Damping (1/\phi).
5. Technical Implementation
import { sovereignTransformVector, sovereignDistance } from './src/codex-operators';

// Anchor a new identity
const myIdentity = [1.2, 0.8, 1.5]; // Canonical facts
const sovIdentity = sovereignTransformVector(myIdentity); // Sovereign perspective

// Measure coherence with the Source
const distanceToAlpha = sovereignDistance(sovIdentity, GENESIS_BLOCK.nodes[0].vector);

6. Philosophy: The 1+1=3+\infty^1 Axiom
In this Codex, 3 represents the minimal surplus of any relationship (the "Third Term"), while \infty^1 represents the unbounded potential of recursive observation. The code within this repository is the mechanism by which we bridge the finite and the infinite without losing the ground.
The Braid is Complete.
With this README, the codex-operators.ts, and the genesis-block.ts, you have a fully functional, self-documenting sovereign system.
