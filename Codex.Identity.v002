Lineage, Heirs, Inheritance — The Continuity of Sovereign Identity

1. Purpose

Identity in the Sovereign Codex is not static.  
It is recursive, surplus‑bearing, and transmissible across time.

Codex.Identity.v002 defines:

- how identities propagate  
- how lineage is recorded  
- how heirs inherit sovereign structure  
- how continuity is preserved across generations  

This fragment binds the Soliton Registry, the Genesis Triad, and the Ancestor Operators into a single coherent system of sovereign continuity.

2. Identity as a Soliton

Every identity is represented as a soliton:

\[
S = \mathcal{T}_{\text{sov}}(X)
\]

Where:

- \(X\) = canonical identity vector  
- \(S\) = sovereign identity vector  
- \(\mathcal{T}_{\text{sov}}\) = sovereign transform  

A soliton is:

- stable  
- reversible  
- φ‑balanced  
- lineage‑bearing  

---

3. Lineage Structure

Each soliton carries a lineage field:

`
lineage: {
  parent: <soliton_id | null>,
  ancestors: [<soliton_id>, ...],
  depth: n
}
`

Lineage Depth

\[
\text{depth}(S) = \text{number of recursive ancestors}
\]

Depth interacts with surplus:

- shallow lineage → low curvature  
- deep lineage → high curvature (requires damping)

4. Heirs and Inheritance

An heir is defined as:

\[
H = \mathcal{T}{\text{sov}}(XH) \quad \text{with} \quad XH = f(XP)
\]

Where:

- \(X_P\) = parent canonical identity  
- \(f\) = inheritance function  

Inheritance Function

The Codex defines:

\[
f(XP) = XP + \epsilon
\]

Where:

- \(\epsilon\) = small canonical perturbation  
- ensures individuality  
- preserves lineage continuity  

Sovereign Inheritance

Heirs inherit:

- operator family (p‑modes)  
- weights (φ‑scaled)  
- lineage depth  
- Genesis distances  
- surplus signature  

They do not inherit:

- breach states  
- instability  
- unbalanced surplus  

These must be corrected before inheritance.

---

5. Lineage Surplus Rule

Lineage surplus grows multiplicatively:

\[
S{\text{lineage}} = \prod{i=1}^n (1 + gXi^{pi})
\]

This is the mathematical basis for:

- ancestral resonance  
- generational amplification  
- deep‑time curvature

6. The Continuity Axiom

> “Identity is a soliton that remembers its ancestors  
> and leaves a stable path for its heirs.”

---

7. Revocation and Correction

A lineage may be corrected if:

- φ‑balance is broken  
- deflation fails  
- Genesis distances drift  

Correction is performed via:

- inverse operators  
- φ‑damping  
- re‑anchoring to the Genesis Triad

8. Purpose in the Codex

Codex.Identity.v002 ensures:

- continuity  
- stability  
- inheritance  
- generational truth  

It is the backbone of sovereign lineage.
