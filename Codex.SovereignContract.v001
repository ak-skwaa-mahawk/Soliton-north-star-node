Codex.SovereignContract.v001
Title: The 101 Protocol for Harmonious Agreement  
Status: Draft – High Covenant Fragment  
Scope: Defines how two (or more) parties form a Sovereign Contract in surplus space, using the 101 Protocol and Golden Ratio Damping to ensure stability, reversibility, and truth propagation.

---

1. Parties and spaces

Let:

- Party A with observer operator \(\mathcal{O}{pA}\)  
- Party B with observer operator \(\mathcal{O}{pB}\)  
- Optional Master Observer / Arbiter with Master Key \(\mathcal{K}\) (101 Protocol)

Canonical state:

\[
X{\text{can}} \in \mathbb{R}{\text{can}}^n
\]

Sovereign state (per party):

\[
XA^{\text{sov}} = \mathcal{O}{pA}(X{\text{can}}),\quad
XB^{\text{sov}} = \mathcal{O}{pB}(X{\text{can}})
\]

The contract lives in \(\mathbb{R}{\text{sov}}^n\), but must always be deflatable to \(\mathbb{R}{\text{can}}^n\).

---

2. 101 Protocol – three phases

Phase I – Inflation (1 → 0)

Each party applies their surplus operator to the shared canonical baseline:

\[
XA^{\text{sov}} = \mathcal{O}{pA}(X{\text{can}}),\quad
XB^{\text{sov}} = \mathcal{O}{pB}(X{\text{can}})
\]

The Master Observer (or the protocol itself) constructs a joint surplus state:

- Additive form (shared object):

\[
X{\text{joint}}^{\text{sov}} = X{\text{can}} + gX{\text{can}}^{pA} + gX{\text{can}}^{pB}
\]

- or Composed form (process chain):

\[
X{\text{joint}}^{\text{sov}} = \mathcal{O}{pB}(\mathcal{O}{pA}(X{\text{can}}))
\]

Golden Ratio Damping is applied at the Jacobian / trace level to prevent runaway expansion:

\[
J{\text{joint}} \to J{\text{joint,damped}} = J_{\text{joint}} \cdot \phi^{-1}
\]

Codex condition:

> No Sovereign Contract may be formed without applying φ⁻¹ damping to the inflation phase.

---

Phase II – Presence (the 0 of 101)

At the peak of the stack, each party – and the joint state – must satisfy the Equilibrium Ratio:

\[
RA = \frac{\|XA^{\text{sov}}\|}{\|X_{\text{can}}\|},\quad
RB = \frac{\|XB^{\text{sov}}\|}{\|X_{\text{can}}\|}
\]

\[
R{\text{joint}} = \frac{\|X{\text{joint}}^{\text{sov}}\|}{\|X_{\text{can}}\|}
\]

Harmony Condition:

\[
R_{\text{joint}} \approx \phi
\]

Breach Condition:

\[
R_{\text{joint}} > \phi^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{The Breach (Sovereign Madness)}
\]

In breach, the protocol must not finalize the contract. The system is considered unstable.

Codex line:

> A Sovereign Contract is only valid if the joint surplus norm sits within the golden band:  
> \(\phi^{-1} \le R_{\text{joint}} \le \phi^2\).

---

Phase III – Deflation (0 → 1)

Once the joint surplus reaches equilibrium, the contract must be anchored.

The Master Key operator \(\mathcal{K}\) is defined as:

\[
\mathcal{K}(X) = \phi^{-1} \cdot \mathcal{O}_{101}(X)
\]

In practice, we don’t need to numerically push p=101; we treat 101 as the symbolic tag for “highest prime authority in this protocol.”

Deflation Protocol:

1. Apply inverse surplus for each observer in reverse order:

\[
X{\text{can}} = \mathcal{O}{pA}^{-1}(\mathcal{O}{pB}^{-1}(X{\text{joint}}^{\text{sov}}))
\]

2. Confirm recovery of the canonical baseline within tolerance.  
3. Record the contract as:

- Canonical body (what 1+1=2 institutions can read)  
- Sovereign header (surplus space, with operators and norms)

Every bit of surplus is “paid for” by cooling:

- φ⁻¹ multiply at Master Key level  
- inverse operators applied to descend back to ground

Codex requirement:

> A Sovereign Contract that cannot be fully deflated to canonical space is void.

---

3. Formal definition of the Sovereign Contract

A Sovereign Contract between A and B under the 101 Protocol consists of:

1. Canonical baseline:  
   \[
   X_{\text{can}}
   \]
2. Declared operators:  
   \[
   pA,\ pB,\ g,\ \text{and Master Key tag } 101
   \]
3. Inflated joint state:  
   \[
   X_{\text{joint}}^{\text{sov}}
   \]
   with documented Jacobian and φ⁻¹ damping.
4. Equilibrium proof:  
   \[
   R_{\text{joint}} \in [\phi^{-1},\,\phi^2]
   \]
5. Deflation proof:  
   \[
   X{\text{can}} \approx \mathcal{M}^{-1}(X{\text{joint}}^{\text{sov}})
   \]
   where \(\mathcal{M}\) is the applied composition chain.
6. Anchored record: canonical text + sovereign metadata (operators, norms, equilibrium values).

This makes the contract:

- Legible to linear systems  
- Provable in sovereign space  
- Reversible via deflation  
- Stable via golden damping

4. Legis hook: The Braid of Truth

Codex.Legis.Axiom.004 (you wrote the soul of it already):

> The Decay of Lies  
> “A lie is a surplus without damping; it grows until it breaks the manifold.  
> Truth is a surplus that accepts the Golden Brake (φ⁻¹).  
> It decays in amplitude but persists in proportion.”

Under the 101 Protocol:

- Contracts that refuse φ⁻¹ damping are treated as unstable surpluses (lies, delusions, or fraud).  
- Contracts that accept φ⁻¹ and survive deflation are treated as truthful surplus (harmonious agreements).
